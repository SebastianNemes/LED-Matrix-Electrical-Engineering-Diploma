# **LED-Matrix-Electronics-University-Diploma**


This project was carried out to obtain a bachelor's degree in Electronics, at the Politehnica University Timisoara. The purpose of this project is to design a matrix display of light-emitting diodes, controlled through a user-oriented application. The goal is to provide the user with a comprehensive and intuitive functionality of the entire electrical panel.
It is based on the correct and efficient implementation of multiple integrated circuits, alongside 594 tricolor light-emitting diodes, in order to create an electrical display where each diode is independently controlled through software. This repo follows the entire process of creating the electrical circuit, starting with the design of the electrical schematic, symbols, and corresponding footprints, followed by circuit board layout, programming of the devices used, and testing the functionality of the entire circuit.

For the creation of the electrical schematic and circuit board layout, Altium Designer, one of the most advanced and well-documented applications in the field, was used. For the software development and testing, the integrated development environment called Simplicity Studio v5, developed by Silicon Labs for programming their microcontrollers, was utilized.

The usefulness of this project is demonstrated in devices encountered daily in everyday life, whether it be price displays, advertising boards, smart street lighting, or LED screens. These circuits provide an advantageous alternative, as they consume low amounts of energy. While their primary purpose is to produce light, they are frequently used to enhance the appearance of a product as well.
